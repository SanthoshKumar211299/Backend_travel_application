-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you're planning a big trip and start researching where to go and what to do, it soon becomes apparent that there are so many options. And what about when you're at a party and the host's friend's boss' wife recommends that you go to a really great place to eat in a tiny village that you desperately want to remember. This travel planner replaces endless post-it notes, scribbles on the back of receipts and scrwals on the back of your hand that are bound to go a-miss.

Create your own profile and build a trip where you can collate all your plans for places to go to eat, visit, activities to do and facts you want to remember.
